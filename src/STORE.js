                    'Livy begins his Third Decade with a prefatory statement that establishes the topic of the books that follow and defines them as a distinct unit within the Ab Urbe Condita.

                    'Livy ends the chapter with the famous story of Hamilcar Barca—angered by the terms of the treaty which ended the First Punic War (264 - 241 BCE) —compelling his son, Hannibal, to promise that he would become an enemy of Rome.',
